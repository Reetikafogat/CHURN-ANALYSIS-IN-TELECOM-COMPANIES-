📊 CHURN-ANALYSIS-IN-TELECOM-COMPANIES-
🔍This is a data analysis/science  project that i did to analyze the churn rate in telecom companies . I have used sql, power bi  and 
     ml .

📈📉ABOUT THE PROJECT:

📍 I Conducted end-to-end analysis of customer churn using SQL for data extraction, cleaning, and feature engineering from a relational database.The sql queries I used to clean the data are in the file SQL QUERIES. After cleaning i loaded the data into Power Bi dashboard by connecting it to sql server.

📍 Designed and developed interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key churn KPIs such as churn rate, customer tenure, and service-based churn breakdown.

📊 Key Insights from Churn Analysis Dashboard
✅ 1. Overall Churn Rate
The overall churn rate is significant, suggesting a need for immediate retention strategies.

✅ 2. High-Risk Segments
Month-to-month contract users show the highest churn — this segment lacks long-term commitment and may be price-sensitive or dissatisfied.
Senior citizens have a higher churn rate compared to other age groups, indicating they may need more tailored support or communication.

✅ 3. Tenure Impact
Customers with lower tenure (0–12 months) are far more likely to churn, emphasizing the importance of early engagement and onboarding efforts.

✅ 4. Service Influence on Churn
Churn is notably higher among users with:
Fiber Optic Internet
No Tech Support
No Online Backup or Protection Plan
This suggests dissatisfaction with service performance or lack of added-value services.

✅ 5. Payment Method Correlation
Users paying via electronic checks churn more than those using credit cards or auto-pay options, possibly due to lower trust or satisfaction.

📍 After finding valuable insights The actions that can be taken by the Telecom companies to reduce churn Rate are:

✅ Target new customers (first 12 months) with onboarding campaigns, loyalty rewards, or personalized support.

✅ Promote long-term contracts with discounts or added perks to reduce month-to-month churn.

✅ Bundle essential services like tech support and online protection to boost retention.

✅ Investigate performance issues or dissatisfaction drivers with fiber internet customers.

✅ Encourage stable payment methods like auto-pay to reduce churn likelihood.

📍 Machine Learning Summary
 
- Trained Logistic Regression classifier model to make predictions on the churn data.
- Logistic Regression performed best with ~85% accuracy.
- Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and joblib for model saving.
